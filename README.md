# Money Matters

This is a game made using React. The best way to describe how to play is:

Your name is Tony Pepperoni and you have $250 to put on a rockin show. You get to pick the headliner, promotion style, venue, and the security. Sometimes the most expensive option isnâ€™t the best one, so choose carefully!

Your goal is to put on the best rock show without going over your budget. Anything not used or money earned during the show wil go to the next round.

Good luck!

## TODO - *Important*

- Setup tutorial/front page 
- There is a bug where sometimes after returning to the game area all of the options are disabled despite the wallet having money. 

## Nice to have 

- Add new tiers to each category letting player purchase an upgrade and have the chance at making more money
- Add hints to which solution might be the most effective and why
- Edit results page to show how much money was made each show and what went wrong/went well/how player can improve next time
- Add a meter that shows how well the show did and how much each category contributed to the total
- Add sound! Music and effects
- Edit categories to be more fun! Edit radio buttons, get to fit closer to figma file
