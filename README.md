#Money Matters

This is a game made by me using React. The best way to describe how to play is:

Your name is Tony Pepperoni and you have $250 to put on a rockin show. You get to pick the headliner, promotion style, venue, and the security. Sometimes the most expensive option isnâ€™t the best one, so choose carefully!

Your goal is to put on the best rock show without going over your budget. Anything not used or money earned during the show wil go to the next round.

Good luck!
